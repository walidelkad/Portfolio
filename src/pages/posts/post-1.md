# My Works

Welcome to my works

## What I've accomplished

1. **Graphic Design**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **My websites**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **My designs**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
